# Vite React Starter

This is a simple starter template for building React applications using Vite. Vite is a build tool that provides fast development server and optimized production builds. This template sets up a basic React project with Vite, allowing you to quickly get started with your React development.

## Features

- **Fast Development:** Vite provides a lightning-fast development server with hot module replacement (HMR), making the development experience smooth and efficient.

- **Optimized Production Builds:** Vite generates highly optimized production builds for your React application, resulting in faster load times and improved performance.

- **React Pre-configured:** This template comes pre-configured with React, allowing you to start writing React components right away.

- **ESM Modules:** Vite uses native ES modules (ESM) for faster loading in modern browsers.

- **CSS Pre-processing:** You can use your preferred CSS pre-processor (such as Sass or Less) by simply installing the corresponding Vite plugin.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting Started

To create a new React project using this template, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vite-react-starter.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd vite-react-starter
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm or Yarn:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install

   # Using Yarn
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm run dev

   # Using Yarn
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see your React application running.

## Building for Production

To build your React application for production, run the following command:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run build

# Using Yarn
yarn build
```

This will generate optimized production files in the `dist` directory that you can deploy to a web server.

## Customize

Feel free to customize this template to suit your project's needs. You can add additional dependencies, configure CSS preprocessors, and organize your code in any way that makes sense for your application.
